# delicious2xtm

Ruby script using `nokogiri` gem to convert [delicious export](https://secure.delicious.com/settings/bookmarks/export) (saved as `delicious.htm` in same directory) to [XTM 2.0](http://isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-xtm/).

Inspired by http://dannyayers.com/2010/12/17/del.icio.us-bookmarks-to-RDF

Thanks to Jan Schreiber for the pointer.
